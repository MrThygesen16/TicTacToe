# TicTacToe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

Quick little 2-player console based version of Tic-Tac-Toe that I threw together.


Here is an example of what the game looks like while running.

```
Turn #7 | Mike's turn [O]

     A     B     C  
   _________________
  |     |     |     |
0 |  O  |     |  X  |
  |_____|_____|_____|
  |     |     |     |
1 |  X  |  X  |     |
  |_____|_____|_____|
  |     |     |     |
2 |  O  |     |  O  |
  |_____|_____|_____|

Mike, please choose a number... 
1. A0	 2. B0	 3. C0
4. A1	 5. B1	 6. C1
7. A2	 8. B2	 9. C2
Choice: 6

```

When the user enters in the number `6`, the game will update, allowing the other player to input their selection:


```
Turn #8 | Peter's turn [X]

     A     B     C
